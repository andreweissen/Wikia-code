### Wikia JavaScript & CSS ###

#### About ####

These sample JS/CSS userscripts were written by me for Wikia's forked MediaWiki 1.19 framework, and perform a variety of functions, from deleting pages in categories to changing the appearance of default skins. They are widely used by many users and wikis across the network. Please note that this list is not complete and may not be entirely updated with the production branches stored on the FANDOM Open Source Library.

The complete list, containing links to documentation and the production branches themselves, may be found on [my userpage](http://dev.wikia.com/wiki/User:Eizen) (formerly [here](http://dev.wikia.com/wiki/User:Count_of_Howard?redirect=no)). It is recommended that those who wish to view the pages on the wiki itself enable an adblocker.
